Why did you choose this data set: It is a data set I collected and would like to publish
What I've learned from EDA and IDA: I've learned how to load my data using python and how to visualize the spectral signatures. I have missing values and they are missing completely at random. I will impute
the missing values using KNN. 
What preprocessing steps have you completed: loading data, visualizing spectral footprints
What you've tried with streamlit: I have started making my app with tabs, introductory information, and plots. I haven't successfully deployed from github, but I will ask about how to do this in class. 
Additionally, I will be incorporating an interactive element: a slider.
