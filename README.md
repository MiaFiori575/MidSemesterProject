This file contains the near infrared spectral data collected from deionized water, blackwater, and treated blackwater. In addition, physiochemical parameters like turbidity (NTU), percent total solids (TS) and percent total suspended solids. A correlation between spectral signature, turbidity and other physiochemical parameters will be attempted. If a correlation exists, this will be submitted as a new way to quantify TS and TSS in the field so as to avoid the 24-hour processing time for TS and TSS results from samples

**Why did you choose this data set:** It is a data set I collected and would like to publish
**What I've learned from EDA and IDA:** I've learned how to load my data using python and how to visualize the spectral signatures. I have missing values and they are missing completely at random. I will impute
the missing values using KNN. 
**What preprocessing steps have you completed:** loading data, visualizing spectral footprints
**What you've tried with streamlit:** I have started making my app with tabs, introductory information, and plots. I haven't successfully deployed from github, but I will ask about how to do this in class. 
Additionally, I will be incorporating an interactive element: a slider.
